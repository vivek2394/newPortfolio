# 🌐 3D Awwwards-Level Developer Portfolio

### Built with React, GSAP, Three.js, TailwindCSS

This is a fully animated, interactive, 3D developer portfolio designed to **impress clients, recruiters, and hiring managers**. It's more than a portfolio—it's a web experience built with production-level code, scroll-based animations, and real-world best practices.

> ⚡ Inspired by Awwwards-level sites — built with React (Vite), TailwindCSS, GSAP, React Three Fiber, and Drei.
